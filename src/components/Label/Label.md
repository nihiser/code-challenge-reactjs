### Label
The `Label` component is a container that consumes a text and has a `divider` prop that allows for displaying a type of list with a `•` to the right of the text.

## Notes
Fun Fact: `•` is called an interpunct. 

| prop | type | options | required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| divider | `bool` |||
| `large` |` bool` |||
