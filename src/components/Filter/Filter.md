### Filter
One of the more complex components, behind the scenes. As filters are applied, Apollo will update the query variables and refetch data fitting the new criteria.

## Notes
As a filter is applied, any previous filters that have been applied will persist. 

`Clear All` will clear out all of the filter options and refetch the original queries and reset local state defaults.
