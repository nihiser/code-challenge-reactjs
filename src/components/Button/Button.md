### Button
This is a general button component that only takes one prop, `inverted`.

## Notes
The width of the button is `100%` so it will need to be wrapped with a container in order to adjust size.

| prop | type | options | required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| inverted | bool | | |
| onClick | func | | |
